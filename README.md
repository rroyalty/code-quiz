# Code-Quiz

## Description 

The following is the README for the project code-quiz, which is the repository created for the fourth homework assignment of the UNH Bootcamp course. For the assignment, I was tasked with creating a multiple choice quiz (about coding) that utilizes a countdown timer and local storage for high score results. Instead of making my questions about coding, I went with pop culture (since I still know more about that than coding. lol.)
