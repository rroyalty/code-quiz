# code-Quiz

## Description 

The following is the README for the project code-quiz, which is the repository created for the fourth homework assignment of the UNH Bootcamp course. For the assignment, I was tasked with creating a multiple choice quiz (about coding) that utilizes a countdown timer and local storage for high score results. Instead of making my questions about coding, I went with pop culture (since I still know more about that than coding. lol.)

![Example given:](https://github.com/rroyalty/H3-password-generator/blob/main/Assets/03-javascript-homework-demo.png)  

For this project, I opted to steer away from JavaScript alerts and prompts, and to instead build my validation straight into the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. (Alerts and Prompts are ugly.)  

Defaults upon HTML load for the password to be generated are 24 characters with all character sets selected. The slide bar for selecting password length is set to a range of 8 to 128 characters. Upon de-selecting every character set, the generate buttno becomes disable and warning HTML objects are made visible.
